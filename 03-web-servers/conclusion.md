## What's next?

In this module, we basically ran a python web application that returns a simple "Hello World!" back to the requesting client. This unforunately is not a real world example only something that we've toyed with to learn the basics of reverse proxying and load balancing.

What happens if we add state, and other components to an application. This is more real world, because an app like Twitter will have multiple components just like that. A database to store tweets, user data, an application that will communicate with the database, and a user interface (mobile app, or website).

How does managing all these componenets look and feel like? This is what we will explore in the next module.

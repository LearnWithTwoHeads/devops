## Real World Applications

As you browse around on applications on a daily basis, what is visual to you is the user interface. For Twitter it is usually the tweets feed. For Instagram it is usually the home feed, so on and so forth.

What is not explicitly seen is everything else called the "backend" which usually comprises of the bare minimum of some applications/services and a storage layer (database), making up a huge chunk of a platform.

What I like to equate this to is an iceberg:

You can always see the top of an iceberg which in this case is the front end, but what you do not see is the backend (rest of the iceberg underwater), a big part of the applications identity.

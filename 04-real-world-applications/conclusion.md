## What's next?

For the past two lessons we have been ssh'ing into our instance and editing files directly (`python` files). What happens when we want to add new features to our application, do we have to ssh onto the instance every time we want to make changes? Editing files directly on machines is a recipe for disaster, we are humans and are liable for making some mistakes. Generally, you would want another copmuter to automate this process of moving files back and forth between your machine, or installing software on your machine, etc.

In the next module, we will learn about how to automate a process like this so we do not have to ssh directly onto our machine. Specifically, we will be learning about [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and automation practices in general.

## Linux

### Intro
- Overview
    - What is Linux?
    - Why use Linux?
    - How to get started with Linux?
- What is Linux?
    - An open source operating system (the code that makes it up is free and available to look through)
    - Built on the Unix operating system principles (unix also powers MacOS)
    - Originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991
- Why use Linux?
    - Linux powers a large majority of the web today, mainly because of relative ease of operation and installation. Works on top of a lot of hardware
    - Secure, efficient, open source, and a lot of community support
    - Relatively thin without a lot of pre-packaged software, so fits most purposes of serving things to consumers
- Linux Distributions
    - Linux distributions are variations of the Linux operating system
    - Examples of distributions:
        - Ubuntu
        - Fedora
        - Debian
        - CentOS
        - Arch Linux
        - Alpine
        The list goes on and on...
    - Type of distribution you want to use is tied to your specific use case (Give example about Alpine being thinner compared to other distros)
- Linux: Day to day (DevOps)
    - Since most servers run Linux, it is important to know how to use it as you log into a server (There are a lot of tools that abstract this away but still useful to know)
    - Bash scripting for automating different things for efficiency

### Body
- How to get started with Linux?
    - Many ways to get started with Linux: install it directly on hardware, use a VM, or containerization technologies for Linux images (simplest way is with VM or containerization)
    - Choose path forward and distribution you want to use. For this tutorial we'll use one of the most popular ones (Ubuntu)
- The Terminal
    - Terminal is a program that allows you to do many things on the Linux operating system, including: managing the filesystem, executing commands, installing software, configuring machine, etc. (funny comment about hacker movies)
    - As a developer/DevOps you spend most of your time in the terminal doing various things
- Prompt
    - The terminal's default state is a prompt waiting for you to issue some commands
    - Linux executes those commands if it undestands it and has the OS manage the processs
    - We can look at some very basic commands here:
        - `ls`
        - `cd`
        - `mkdir`
        - `whoami`
    - Commands go out and run processes, and the prompt returns again
- Processes
    - Any command that you issue most likely starts a process that Linux manages through the OS
    - Processes have a lifetime according to the what the program does, and can eventually exit successfully or non-successfully, this can be internally/externally influenced
- Process management
    - It is important to examine processes on the OS and see what is happening
    - You can see processes by running the `ps aux` command, and this gives a wealth of information
    - The command tells you the user who owns that process (note for later), the identifier of the process known as the PID, the command that started the process, etc.
- Resource Management
    - Processes are given some OS resources to run, and some need more resources than others
    - `top` command shows you more information about the up-to-date state of a process, resource utilization, state of the process, etc.
    - You can terminate processes manually (external influence) many different ways, some more safer than others relatively. Manual process termination is dependent on use case
    - `df` 
- Users
    - We talked about how a user owns a process, and where to find that information but what does this mean?
    - You can create users on linux by utilizing some commands. Creation of a user usually includes a creation of a directory for them
    - Process are owned by the user that invoked the command, and you can find the current user by the command `whoami`
    - You can run a process as the `root` user by sticking the `sudo` keyword before the actual command. That stands for "super user do"
    - By default, only the root user can do certain actions on Linux (for security reasons)
- Adding a user
    - `useradd ...`
- Deleting a user
    - `userdel ...`
- Permissions
    - Linux has a nice permission model for actions that can be done on a file, directory, or program
    - File permissions can be viewed by doing a long listing in a directory `ls -l`, as well as the user that owns the file
    - The pattern for permission groups are (user, group, and every body else)
    - The `r` stands for read, `w` stands for write, and `x` stands for execute, and each permission group "can" do one of the following according to the permissions it has
- Change Permission
    - You can change permissions of a file by using the `chmod` command
    - It is important to use the principle of least permissions when managing them for files in your system
    - `7` stands for full permission set, `6` stands for read and write, `4` stands for only read, `2` stands for only write, `5` stands for read and execute, so on and so forth
- Change Ownership
    - In some cases you would need to change ownership of a file
    - Comes up a lot in containerization (due to not running processes as root, and the process having to write data somewhere that is owned by root)
    - Example previous point: web server (long lived processes, extra information about ports)
- Bash scripting
    - Very useful for short automations on things that you will do on the terminal/command line
    - Inefficient for doing moderate to heavy programming and a higher level language should be used instead (python, perl, ruby, node.js)
    - Can write your own automations and store them in your bash functions to execute on command line
- File viewing and editing
    - You can view the contents of a file by using the `cat` command
    - To make edits to a file you can use `nano` or `vi` which live on almost all linux OSs
    - Very important to learn how to edit with these editors since you could be ssh'ing into a server and have to edit some files

## What's next?

As multiple developers are contributing to one code base, there becomes increased risk in introducing bugs/defects and all sorts of other issues into the code base. We are all humans and are all prone to writing incorrect software at times. We do however, want to lower the risk of introducing bugs into the software as much as possible, especially if customers are depending on sound operation of the application. With all that being said, what is the best way of trying to prevent bugs from entering the code base?

The answer is CI/CD.

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It allows for introducing some processes of validating a code base's behavior in any way the owner of the code base wants to do it. We will learn about CI/CD in depth in the next module!

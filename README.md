# DevOps
This repository is open and free. Intended to teach and spread DevOps knowledge everywhere it needs to reach.

The way that the lessons in this repository are structured tell a story on how we have arrived at modern devops. There exists a lot of tools that many engineers use today that are just tools to help deal with certain problems at scale whether a logical or technical problem.

This repository is meant to be self-serving, but with learning anything new, there is always a learning curve. Therefore, there will be support surrounding the material that lives in this repository, in the form of:

- Office Hours
- Lectures
- Slack community


These will all come in the future: ðŸ”œ, so stay tuned!

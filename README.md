# DevOps
This repository is open and free. Intended to teach and spread DevOps knowledge everywhere it needs to reach.

This repository is meant to be self-serving, but with learning anything new, there is a bit of a learning curve. Therefore, there will be support surrounding the material that lives in this repository, in the form of:

- Office Hours
- Lectures
- Slack community

These will all come in the future: ðŸ”œ, so stay tuned!

## Linux

Learning Linux one of the most important basis of any practical IT job, and DevOps engineering is no expection to that.

What is the reason for that? Well, according to this [article](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/linux-statistics.html#:~:text=Linux%20is%20used%20to%20power,the%20world's%20top%20web%20servers.&text=In%20fact%2C%2096.3%25%20account%20for,%25), Linux powers around 96.3% of the worlds top web servers. To put it simply, it is the king OS of the internet.

However, why is Linux so popular when it comes to the internet and why is it needed for the DevOps profession?

This is what we will learn in this module, as well as actually spinning up a Linux machine for our own personal use.

### Why Linux?
In my opinion, the biggest reason why Linux is the preferred OS to any other OS when it comes to the internet is because of the open-source nature of the OS.

You can actually find all of the source code for Linux on the web [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux). The code being open-source allows for anybody to run it, build on top of it, and create a forks/variants of Linux. This has already been done many many times, as these variations are called Linux [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) or distros (for short).

These distributions of Linux are sometimes optimized for certain things. For instance, Kali Linux is a distribution that comes with a lot of pre-installed tools to help users get started with penetration testing and ethical hacking. Another example is Alpine Linux, which is a super lightweight distribution without a lot of pre-installed software optimized for simple use cases, like users just wanting to run their own processes. Alpine is super popular in the microservices world (which we will learn about later).

With OSs like Windows, and MacOS, these are closed source offerings and are actually pretty expensive to run. You can read more in depth about the differences between the three OSs [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/linux-vs-mac-vs-windows-operating-system/#:~:text=Unlike%20Windows%20and%20macOS%2C%20Linux,can%20install%20on%20older%20PCs.).

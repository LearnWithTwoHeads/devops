## CI/CD

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. One of the most important parts of the modern Software Development lifecycle. Basically, as companies combine these two processes, they can seek to achieve a safe, streamlined, and consistent delivery of software.

Continuous Integration (can consist of):
- Testing the software at hand to check for any bugs
- Checking the format of your code
- Building a deliverable piece of software that can be ran wherever needed

Continuous Deployment (can consist of):
- Delivering the built software by CI somewhere (running on a machine or push to a Cloud somewhere)

The way I like to think about CI/CD is a Doctor for my software. Basically, if a organization plans on making changes to a code base, we have to make sure that everything is alright with those changes before we release them out for users to eventually use, just as a Doctor checks on you to see if everything is alright before releasing your from the hospital if you are sick.

We will be experimenting with CI/CD with our three-tier web architecture application throughout this module!

## Getting Started

There exists a lot of tooling that provide a CI/CD or CI/CD like experience. Which one to choose is really a matter of functionality first preference, and familiarity.

A tool that has stood the test of time throughout the years, and still proves to be powerful is [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). Jenkins is actually marketed as a general purpose automation service, but in a lot of CI/CD circles you will see Jenkins come up quite a lot.

We will not be using Jenkins to run our CI/CD processes, but I think Jenkins is still important to know. In an extracirriculur lab, we will be using Jenkins for automating builds and tests.

In 2018, GitHub officially launched their SaaS product that provides a CI/CD like experience, and that is GitHub Actions. This is the service we will be using throughout this module. GitHub actions is nice because it integrates directly with your repository.

Within the repository itself all you need to do is specify a couple of files, and boom, you are off and running with CI pipelines.

For other CI/CD providers the setup with your GitHub repo can be a bit more cumbersome. This is why I think using GitHub Actions will be the most fruitful for the purposes of learning the concepts of CI/CD.

Without futher ado, let us get started.
